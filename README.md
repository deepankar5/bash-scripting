# bash-scripting
FreeCodeCamp learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs

1)In questionnaire.sh you work in basic input and output statements with use of "echo" and "read" commands.

2)In countdown.sh you work with 'sleep', conditional statements('if and else') and loop('for'and 'while') in bash.

3)In bingo.sh you will learn to generate a random number and use of 'if' and 'else' chain.

4)In forture.sh we will learn about 'until' to run a program until that condition is statisfied.

5)In five.sh we use all the 4 code simultaneously.
